# Tech Challenge

This is a front-end programming exercise to gauge knowledge of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js

For more information on installing Node.js, see [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). If you are unsure what version of Node.js runs on your system, run `node -v` in a terminal window.

* npm package manager

To check that you have the npm client installed, run `npm -v` in a terminal window.

## Run the application

Application includes a gulp and browserSync, for you to build and serve your app locally.

1. Navigate to the workspace folder `s-test`.

```
cd s-test
```

2. Run the following command to install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Development server

Run `gulp wwatch` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build
